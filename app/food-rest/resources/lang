The /food-rest/food-rest/resources/lang directory is intended to contain language files for localization. Since you haven't specified any particular language files to create, I will provide a structure for a typical language file in Laravel.

Here are the contents for a default English language file, which you can name `en.json`:

{
    "login": "Login",
    "username": "Username",
    "password": "Password",
    "remember_me": "Remember Me",
    "forgot_password": "Forgot Your Password?"
}

You can create additional language files (e.g., `es.json` for Spanish) in the same directory as needed.
